            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p>We know you have lots of questions about our organization, how it operates, and how you can help. Some questions are asked particularly frequently, and we have gathered them here along with their answers. If you do not see you question here, please to not hesitate to <a class="traditional-link" href="mailto:theboss@replate.noprofit">contact us</a> and we will answer as quickly as possible.</p>
            <section id="questions">
                <div class="question">
                    <h2>Are you a for-profit company?</h2>
                    <p>We are a 501(c) nonprofit organization ! Being
                        a nonprofit helps us provide the best service to
                        our community and especially to our donors and
                        charities. Although we charge for our pickups,
                        those proceeds go directly to our operating
                        expenses, and are not paid to any investors or
                        shareholders.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How do I prepare food for pickup?</h2>
                    <p>Be sure your food is packaged properly and
                        prepared for when your volunteer arrives to pick
                        it up. Food should be packaged in a foil tray with
                        a lid. If there is a chance of your food leaking,
                        please wrap it in aluminum foil or plastic
                        wrap. Proper prepation allows everyone involved to
                        work in the most efficient and timely manner. We
                        appreciate it! </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>What kinds of charities do you work with?</h2>
                    <p>We work with all kinds of nonprofits -
                        shelters, soup kitchens, job training
                        organizations, after school programs, the list
                        goes on and on. We’re happy to support everyone, no
                        matter where they fall on the spectrum of food
                        insecurity. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How much food can you accept in a single
                        donation?</h2>
                    <p>We can accept as much food as you can donate! But as the number of trays in your donation goes up, the fee we charge must rise to cover our costs. Particularly large donations may require advanced notice.</p>
