            <p id="plea-text">We use data science and our proven
                technology to get food from those who find themselves with
                too much to people who find themselves with too
                little. With the closure of offices nation wide, our
                supply of surplus food has all but dried up while food
                insecurity is on the rise. You can help us get meals to
                those most affected by the current public health crisis.</p>

                <h2>What does my donation provide?</h2>
                <p>Your donations of food allow us to help you put the
                    food you have spent so much money and effort
                    preparing to good use when you can not consume all
                    of it in your business operations. It reduces the
                    enviromental impact of disposing of the food
                    through incineration or in a landfill, and reduces
                    the contries terrible statistics on food wastage.</p>
                <p>Monetary donations help us run our office and the
                    servers and other technology that make it possible for
                    us to continue to operate. They pay for the purchase
                    and maintenance of the vehicles our volunteers use to
                    pick-up your food. They also pay for the continual
                    upgrading of our software to make it even easier to
                    continue our service.</p>

                    <p>Using replate at my restaurant helps me to pay
                        back my community for the support and business it
                        has provided me. My employees are happy to know
                        that they are not only helping the business, but
                        also those in need.</p>

                    <p>I have suffered from food insecurity in the
                        past and it makes me feel good to know that I am
                        helping those who still feel it today. I hope all
                        business owners remember where they came from and
                        the opportunities they have been given.</p>
